**Problem**: Insurance pricing can feel like a black box to consumers.

**Solution**: I built an interactive ML tool that predicts insurance costs and explains WHY.

My Insurance Cost Predictor helps users understand:
• How age, BMI, and smoking status affect premiums
• Regional differences in insurance pricing  
• The relative importance of each risk factor
• Real-time cost estimates for different profiles

 **Results**:
- 86.55% prediction accuracy (R² score)
- Interactive web app with instant predictions
- SHAP-powered explanations for transparency
- Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for public access

This project reinforced my belief that ML models should be interpretable and accessible to end users, not just data scientists.

What other "black box" industries could benefit from transparent AI tools?
