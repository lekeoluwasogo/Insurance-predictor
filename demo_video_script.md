## üìã SCRIPT BREAKDOWN

### INTRO (15 seconds)
**[Screen: Streamlit app loading]**

**You say**: 
> "Hi LinkedIn! I'm excited to show you the insurance cost predictor I just built using machine learning. This app achieves 86.55% accuracy and provides transparent predictions using a Random Forest model."

### PART 1: App Overview (20 seconds)
**[Screen: App homepage with title and sidebar]**

**You say**:
> "The app takes customer details like age, BMI, smoking status, and region to predict insurance costs in real-time. Let me show you how it works."

### PART 2: Demo Prediction #1 - Low Risk (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Input low-risk profile]**

**You say** (while filling out form):
> "Let's start with a low-risk profile: 25-year-old female, BMI of 22, non-smoker, no children, living in the Southwest."

**[Click Predict button, show results]**

**You say**:
> "The model predicts around $4,800 annually - a relatively low cost due to young age and non-smoking status. Notice the risk assessment shows 'Low Risk' and the cost breakdown shows smoking status would be the biggest factor if it changed."

### PART 3: Demo Prediction #2 - High Risk (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Change inputs to high-risk profile]**

**You say** (while changing inputs):
> "Now let's see a high-risk profile: 55-year-old male, BMI of 35, smoker, 3 children."

**[Click Predict, show results]**

**You say**:
> "The prediction jumps to over $18,000 - notice the 'High Risk' warning. The cost breakdown clearly shows smoking and BMI as major cost drivers."

### PART 4: Feature Importance (20 seconds)
**[Screen: Scroll to feature importance chart]**

**You say**:
> "The app uses SHAP values to show feature importance. You can see that smoking status, BMI, and age are the top factors affecting insurance costs, which aligns with domain knowledge."

### PART 5: Model Performance (15 seconds)
**[Screen: Show model metrics section]**

**You say**:
> "The technical details show our Random Forest model achieved 86.55% R-squared with hyperparameter tuning, making it reliable for cost predictions."

### PART 6: Technology & Conclusion (20 seconds)
**[Screen: Maybe scroll through code on GitHub or back to app]**

**You say**:
> "Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, this demonstrates end-to-end ML deployment. The code is open source on GitHub. Try the live app yourself - link in the comments!"

### OUTRO (10 seconds)
**[Screen: App homepage or your contact info]**

**You say**:
> "Thanks for watching! Let me know what you think and what other ML projects you'd like to see. Don't forget to like and share!"
