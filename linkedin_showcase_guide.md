# How to Showcase Your Insurance Prediction Demo on LinkedIn

## Option 1: Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud (Recommended)
**Free and easiest option for live demo**

### Steps:
1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Upload your `insurance_demo_app.py` and `requirements.txt` to GitHub
   - Make repository public

2. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository
   - Deploy automatically

3. **Share Live Link on LinkedIn**
   - Post the live app URL
   - Anyone can interact with your demo directly

### LinkedIn Post Example:
```
